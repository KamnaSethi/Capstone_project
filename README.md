OList, an e-commerce company that has faced 
some losses recently and they want to manage 
their inventory so as to reduce any unnecessary 
costs.
 • Now to be able to meet the demands of the 
customers, the company would need to store 
tons and tons of products in warehouses.
 • Since storing these products adds to the costs 
that the company incurs, it is necessary for the 
organization to plan their inventory well.
